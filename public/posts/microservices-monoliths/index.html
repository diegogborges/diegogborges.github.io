Communication Between Services Conclusion Distributed Architectures Are Necessary\nWhy Do Large Companies Need Them? Microservices: The “Bitter Medicine” Reflection When to Choose Monolithic Systems\nWhen to Choose Microservices\nProvocation: Are You Ready for Microservices?\nFinal Analogy\nMicroservices and Event-Driven Architecture Introduction to the Module: Microservices-Based Architecture In this module, we explore the essential foundations of microservices architecture and set expectations so you know exactly what you will learn.\nWhy Study Microservices? Although widely used in large companies, microservices often fail in practice — not because of technical issues, but due to a lack of conceptual understanding among developers, tech leads, and architects.\nThey are frequently adopted for the wrong reasons, without clear goals or mastery of the fundamentals.\nWhat You Will Learn in This Module Fundamentals of microservices-based architecture When to use and when to avoid microservices How microservices work in practice and their challenges Strategies to reduce failure risks How to avoid the “death star” (excessive dependencies) Difference between choreography vs. orchestration Why This Module Matters Most of the content is theoretical, because the biggest challenge is not creating an isolated microservice — that part is simple — but understanding how to compose and organize the entire architecture.\nOur Goal To share solid principles that accelerate your journey and help you avoid common pitfalls.\nMonolithic Systems What Is a Monolithic System? A monolith concentrates all scopes and areas inside a single application.\nCharacteristics All components and features grouped together Simple and direct internal communication Still predominant in the market Teamwork Inside a Monolith Squads work on different parts of the same system Requires organization to avoid Git conflicts Automated tests reduce risks Practical Benefits Lower infrastructure cost Great for small and medium businesses Higher productivity with unified standards Technological Constraints Single programming language No queues, circuit breaker, or multiple databases Simple deployment Deployment Risks If deployment fails, the entire system goes down Microservices reduce this risk Blue-green or canary deployments minimize impact Conclusion About Monoliths Monoliths are simple, efficient, and perfectly suitable for many scenarios — especially early in a project.\nWhat Are Microservices? Microservices are small, independent applications with a well-defined scope.\nCore Principle: SRP A microservice should have a single reason to change (SRP — Single Responsibility Principle).\nRelationship With Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Bounded Contexts help identify services But not every context becomes a microservice Independence and Autonomy Each microservice must:\nContinue working even if others fail Have fallback and resilience mechanisms Example: Graceful Degradation If the account calculation service is down:\n→ Display the last known balance to the user.\nPart of a Bigger Machine A microservice in total isolation is not a microservice — it’s just a small system.\nSummary Clear scope Independent and autonomous Part of an ecosystem More complex communication Microservices-Based Architecture Microservice ≠ Architecture Microservice: a software unit Architecture: how multiple units are organized Main Characteristics Use of Multiple Technologies Each service may use different languages or databases — but this requires governance.\nGovernance vs Total Freedom Standards increase productivity Micromanagement harms development Platform teams usually provide: Templates SDKs Internal development standards Infrastructure tools The Myth of Total Freedom Too many technologies create expensive and hard-to-maintain systems.\nSummary Microservices require:\nGovernance Standardization Balance between freedom and consistency Microservices Setup 1. Less Risky Deployment If one service fails, the others keep running Reduces user impact But increases complexity:\nCI/CD per service Dedicated monitoring Infrastructure per service 2. Specialized Teams Microservices allow:\nDomain-focused teams More technical depth Faster business delivery Scaling Microservices: Reality vs Myth 1. The Promise Scale only the critical parts Reduce resource waste 2. The Hidden Side Many pipelines Higher infrastructure cost More complex monitoring 3. The Myth: “Monoliths Don’t Scale” Monoliths do scale — vertically and horizontally.\n4. Communication Between Services Tools like Kafka, RabbitMQ, or SQS:\nIncrease complexity Require cultural changes Increase operational costs Conclusion Microservices only make sense in large and complex environments.\nDistributed Architectures Are Necessary Why Do Large Companies Need Them? Large teams Large domains Complex business rules Microservices: The “Bitter Medicine” They are:\nHard Expensive Necessary at scale Reflection The choice must depend on context, not trends.\nWhen to Choose Monolithic Systems Ideal for:\nMVPs and POCs Product discovery High uncertainty Low governance maturity Small teams Limited budget Monolith = simple, cheap, and fast.\nWhen to Choose Microservices Best choice when:\nMany teams work simultaneously Domains are well defined Need to scale isolated components Use of multiple technologies Microservices are about scaling organizations, not only systems.\nProvocation: Are You Ready for Microservices? You must master:\nContainers CI/CD Distributed architecture Asynchronous communication Independent databases Observability (logs, metrics, tracing) DDD Final Analogy A distributed environment is like an airplane cockpit:\nYou don’t need to press every button today —\nbut you must know what each one does,\nbecause eventually, you’ll need them.\n",
