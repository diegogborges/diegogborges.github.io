An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of standards and protocols that allow different systems or users to interact with an application.\nIt enables clients to access the software’s features and services without needing direct access to its internal implementation.\nWhat Is a REST API? A REST API (Representational State Transfer API) is an interface that enables communication between systems over the web following REST architectural principles.\nREST APIs use the HTTP protocol and rely on standardized resource-oriented operations.\nKey REST Concepts Resources Resources are the entities exposed by the API—for example, users, products, or orders.\nEach resource is accessed through a unique URL (Uniform Resource Identifier).\nMain HTTP Methods Method Purpose GET Retrieve information about a resource POST Create a new resource PUT Update an existing resource or create it if it does not exist DELETE Remove a resource PATCH Partially modify an existing resource Data Formats REST APIs typically exchange data using:\nJSON (JavaScript Object Notation) – lightweight, simple, widely adopted XML (eXtensible Markup Language) – less common today but still supported 🔧 RESTful API Characteristics 1. Stateless Each request must contain all the information necessary for the server to process it.\nThe server does not store client state between requests.\n2. Client–Server Architecture REST separates:\nClient – responsible for the user interface Server – responsible for data and logic Resources – the objects exchanged between them Communication happens entirely through HTTP.\n3. Cacheability REST APIs should allow responses to be cached whenever possible.\nThis improves performance and reduces unnecessary network calls.\n4. Uniform Interface A uniform interface makes client and server evolve independently.\nA REST API must provide:\nConsistent URLs Standardized HTTP methods Predictable input/output formats This standardization enables seamless integration between systems.\n5. Layered System A REST architecture may include multiple layers with specific roles:\nSecurity Load balancing Routing Caches Gateways Each layer handles part of the request/response lifecycle, improving scalability and maintainability.\nGeneral Recommendations APIs should be grouped by business entities (e.g., products, branches, orders), and within each entity, you should expose CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete).\nFollow these principles:\nFollow REST specification standards. Translate all path names, fields, parameters, and attribute identifiers into English. Document your API in the development documentation portal, then request publication to production documentation. Create test scenarios (success and failure) for each endpoint. Use Plural Nouns in URLs Always favor plural nouns. Examples:\n/customers A specific resource:\n/customers/1234 Avoid URLs with more than two levels!\nKeep the Base URL Simple and Intuitive Correct Structure: Level 1: A collection representing a business entity Level 2: A specific element inside the collection\nExample:\n/customers /customers/1234 Avoid Verb-Based URLs ❌ Avoid these patterns:\n/getCustomers /saveCustomer /deleteCustomer Use HTTP Verbs to Operate on Resources Resource POST GET PUT DELETE /customers Create List all customers Batch update Delete all customers /customers/1234 ❌ Error Get customer 1234 Update customer (if exists) Delete customer Resource Listing and Detail Retrieval When querying collections, return minimal fields (usually identifiers + summary).\nExample — Collection Query\nGET /employees Response:\n{ \"records\": [ { \"cpf\": \"123456\", \"name\": \"HENRIQUE DA SILVA\" }, { \"cpf\": \"8795531\", \"name\": \"PAULO LEITE JUNIOR\" }, { \"cpf\": \"458314\", \"name\": \"ROBERTO PEREIRA DOS SANTOS\" } ] } Example — Detail Query\nGET /employees/123456 Response:\n{ \"records\": [{ \"cpf\": \"123456\", \"name\": \"HENRIQUE DA SILVA\", \"branch\": 500, \"jobTitle\": \"SOLUTION ARCHITECT SENIOR\", \"startDate\": \"2014-09-15T00:00:00-0300\", \"status\": \"Active\" }] } Associations Retrieve all orders for a customer:\nGET /customers/{id}/orders Create an order for a customer:\nPOST /customers/{id}/orders URLs should rarely exceed 3 levels.\nUse Query Parameters to Reduce URL Complexity Use query params for optional filters:\nExample\nGET /orders?salesbranch=1\u0026status=6\u0026zip=14403597 Error Handling Use a small set of HTTP status codes:\nCode Message Use Case 200 OK Successful operation 204 No Content Success, no payload (e.g., DELETE) 207 Multi-Status Batch operations 400 Bad Request Invalid client request 401 Unauthorized Invalid credentials 404 Not Found Resource not found 500 Internal Server Error Server failure Recommended Error Payload Format { \"developerMessage\": \"Technical details and suggestions for resolving the error.\", \"userMessage\": \"User-friendly explanation.\", \"errorCode\": 99999, \"moreInfo\": \"https://example.com/errors/99999\" } Example — 401 Unauthorized { \"developerMessage\": \"OAuth2 access token not provided\", \"userMessage\": \"Authentication Required\", \"errorCode\": 20003, \"moreInfo\": \"http://developer.example.com/errors/20003\" } Versioning Never publish an API without versioning. Prepend the version with v. The version should appear at the leftmost position: /v1/orders Use simple ordinal numbers (no dots). Keep at least one previous version available. Partial Response Use a fields parameter to return only selected attributes:\n/orders/247571913?fields=total,status,branch Pagination Use limit (number of items) and offset (starting point):\n/orders?limit=25\u0026offset=50 Return 25 records from #51 to #75.\nInclude total record count in metadata.\nActions Not Involving Resources Examples:\nCalculations Translations Conversions These do not involve database resources and should use verbs, not nouns.\nExample — currency conversion:\n/convert?from=EUR\u0026to=USD\u0026amount=100 Document clearly that such endpoints behave differently.\nMulti-Format Support To get XML:\n/orders.xml To get a specific order in XML:\n/orders/1234.xml JSON should remain the default format.\nAttribute Naming Attributes in Request/Response Bodies Use camelCase Avoid snake_case and PascalCase Correct:\n\"startDate\": \"2014-08-06T00:00:00-0300\", \"zipCode\": 14403597 Incorrect:\n\"created_at\": \"...\", \"DateTime\": \"...\" Composite types must be nested objects Correct:\n\"type\": { \"id\": 1, \"description\": \"store\" } Incorrect:\n\"typeId\": 1, \"typeDescription\": \"store\" Attributes in URLs (Query Parameters) Always lowercase Use dot notation for nested fields Correct:\n/v1/prices?branch.id=10\u0026item.product.id=41702 Incorrect:\n/v1/prices?branchId=10\u0026itemProductId=41702 Substring filtering /v1/customers?name_contains=John Value ranges /v1/orders?period_greater=2024-01-01\u0026period_lesser=2024-01-02 Attributes in Headers Do not use special characters Remain concise Correct:\nuuidProtocol Incorrect:\nUUID_Protocol References Mulloy, B.

<h3 id="data-formats"><strong>Data Formats</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#data-formats">#</a></h3>
<p>REST APIs typically exchange data using:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)</strong> – lightweight, simple, widely adopted</li>
<li><strong>XML (eXtensible Markup Language)</strong> – less common today but still supported</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="1-stateless"><strong>1. Stateless</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1-stateless">#</a></h3>
<p>Each request must contain all the information necessary for the server to process it.<br>
The server does <strong>not store client state</strong> between requests.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="2-clientserver-architecture"><strong>2. Client–Server Architecture</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-clientserver-architecture">#</a></h3>
<p>REST separates:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Client</strong> – responsible for the user interface</li>
<li><strong>Server</strong> – responsible for data and logic</li>
<li><strong>Resources</strong> – the objects exchanged between them</li>
</ul>
<p>Communication happens entirely through <strong>HTTP</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="3-cacheability"><strong>3. Cacheability</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#3-cacheability">#</a></h3>
<p>REST APIs should allow responses to be <strong>cached</strong> whenever possible.<br>
This improves performance and reduces unnecessary network calls.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="4-uniform-interface"><strong>4. Uniform Interface</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#4-uniform-interface">#</a></h3>
<p>A uniform interface makes client and server evolve independently.<br>
A REST API must provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consistent URLs</li>
<li>Standardized HTTP methods</li>
<li>Predictable input/output formats</li>
</ul>
<p>This standardization enables seamless integration between systems.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="5-layered-system"><strong>5. Layered System</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#5-layered-system">#</a></h3>
<p>A REST architecture may include multiple layers with specific roles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Load balancing</li>
<li>Routing</li>
<li>Caches</li>
<li>Gateways</li>
</ul>
<p>Each layer handles part of the request/response lifecycle, improving scalability and maintainability.</p>
<h1 id="general-recommendations"><strong>General Recommendations</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#general-recommendations">#</a></h1>
<p>APIs should be grouped by business entities (e.g., products, branches, orders), and within each entity, you should expose CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete).</p>
<p>Follow these principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Follow REST specification standards.</li>
<li>Translate all path names, fields, parameters, and attribute identifiers into English.</li>
<li>Document your API in the development documentation portal, then request publication to production documentation.</li>
<li>Create test scenarios (success and failure) for each endpoint.</li>
</ul>
